Microservice Kubernetes Order Processing Application
=====================

Overview
--------

This project creates a complete micro service demo system in Docker
containers. The services are implemented in Java using Spring and
Spring Cloud.



It uses four docker microservices:
- `Apache` homepage and proxy
- `Order` to process orders.
- `Customer` to handle customer data.
- `Catalog` to handle the items in the catalog.

# Components

Apache HTTP Load Balancer
------------------------

Apache HTTP is used to provide the web page of the demo at
port 8080. It also forwards HTTP requests to the microservices. This
is not really necessary as each service has its own port on the
Minikube host but it provides a single point of entry for the whole system.
Apache HTTP is configured as a reverse proxy for this.
Load balancing is left to Kubernetes.

To configure this Apache HTTP needs to get all registered services from
Kubernetes. It just uses DNS for that.

Please refer to the subdirectory [microservice-kubernetes-demo/apache](microservice-kubernetes-demo/apache/) to see how this works.


Java Services
-------------------

The microservices are:

- [microservice-kubernetes-demo-catalog](microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-catalog) is the application to take care of items.
- [microservice-kubernetes-demo-customer](microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-customer) is responsible for customers.
- [microservice-kubernetes-demo-order](microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-order) does order processing. It uses
  microservice-kubernetes-demo-catalog and microservice-kubernetes-demo-customer.

The microservices use REST to communicate to each other.
See e.g. [CatalogClient](microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-order/src/main/java/com/ewolff/microservice/order/clients/CatalogClient.java) .
The hostname is configurable to allow tests with stubs.
The default is `catalog` which works with Kubernetes.
Other microservices are found using Kubernetes built-in DNS.
Kubernetes does the load balancing on the IP level.

# Install/Prepare to run the demo 

### AWS

1. AWS account
2. AWS IAM user - Note this user will need some IAM permissions including roles, policies, OpenID

### Install the AWS CLI

1. [Install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
2. [Configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

```
% aws --version
aws-cli/2.11.5 Python/3.11.2 Darwin/22.3.0 exe/x86_64 prompt/off
```

```
% aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "YYA4ZRSAMPLE6IDAGV2YP",
    "Account": "378929636692",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::378929636692:user/dockerbisson"
}
```

### Tools to install on new laptop
1. Install brew: 
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
2. Install helm: `brew install helm`
3. Install jq: `brew install jq`

### Terraform Cloud

1. [Create account](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account)
2. Create an org - use the org name in the terraform.tf file
3. [Terraform variables with AWS credentials](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started/cloud-create-variable-set)

### Terraform local

From the top level of the repo

1. `brew install terraform` (first time install only  )
2. `terraform init`
3. `terraform plan`
4. `time terraform apply -auto-approve`

### kubectl config

Get `kubectl` config ([more details](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/eks-cluster-connection)):

```
aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name demo-eks
```

The `region` and `name` values match those in the `main.tf` file.

### Build the images
1. Log in to your Docker Hub account by entering `docker login` on the command
line.
2.  Set the environment variable `DOCKER_ACCOUNT` to the name of the account and verify it with echo.
```
export DOCKER_ACCOUNT=your account
echo $DOCKER_ACCOUNT
```

3. If you are running on x86, run `docker-build.sh` in the directory
`microservice-kubernetes-demo`. It builds the images and uploads them to Docker Hub using your account.

3a. If you are running on arm64 (apple silicon), you will need to build images for arm64 and amd64 and push to hub using buildx.  Change to the directory `microservice-kubernetes-demo` and run `./docker-buildx.sh`

### Deploy to EKS
Run `./kubernetes-deploy.sh` in the directory
`microservice-kubernetes-demo` :

```
[~/microservice-kubernetes/microservice-kubernetes-demo]./kubernetes-deploy.sh
deployment "apache" created
service "apache" exposed
deployment "catalog" created
service "catalog" exposed
deployment "customer" created
service "customer" exposed
deployment "order" created
service "order" exposed
```

Confirm the services are running using `kubectl`
```
kubectl get all
```
### Confirm the app is running in EKS (may take a minute or two for the app to be running)

```
open "http://$(kubectl get service -o json | jq -r '.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[].hostname')"
```

### Browser setup (optional, can use preview URL instead)
1. Install the mod header extension for chrome

### Telepresence extension setup (required for GUI or spec intercepts)
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Install telepresence extension

### REQUIRED if you are going to demo the intercept spec method
1. Update the kubernetes context in the apache-intercept.yaml and order-intercept.yaml files in the microservice-kubernetes directory - get it from kubectl
```
kubectl config current-context
```


# Demo Execution

---


## Front end demo
Show the app running in EKS, show the homepage is missing the logo and has two links with the same name

### Update the index.html page to add the telepresence logo and change the link text for the second catalog link and build the image
1. cd to the microservice-kubernetes-demo/apache directory
2. Open the index.html file
3. Add the telepresence logo image (changes are bolded)
```
<body>
```
  **`<img src="images/telepresence-for-docker.svg"/>`**
```
	<h1>Order Processing</h1>
```
4. change the second catalog link in index.html and save(changes have ** around them)
```
				<a href="/catalog/searchForm.html">**Search** Catalog</a>
```
5. Run `docker build --tag=microservice-kubernetes-demo-apache .`

## IMPORTANT - the Spec, GUI and CLI telepresence intercept options are separate.  You can do each of them, but you need to make sure the intercept is down before switching between them.  Please make sure you click the "disconnect/leave" icon when you are switching between these options

### (spec option only)Docker desktop and telepresence create intercept

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to the telepresence extension
3. Select "Get Started" - the Select Cluster for Telepresence Connection Dialog will appear

# Demo cleanup

### Change the app back

1. cd to the apache directory
2. Update the index.html file - remove the image link, change the catalog link back and save
3. cd to the microservice-kubernetes-demo/microservice-kubernetes-demo-order/src/main/java/com/ewolff/microservice/order/logic directory
2. Update the OrderController.java file - change the POST back to DELETE on the delete method (make sure you get the right one)

### Remove the deployed services
1. cd to the microservices-kubernetes-demo directory
2. To remove all services and deployments run `kubernetes-remove.sh`:

```
[~/microservice-kubernetes/microservice-kubernetes-demo]./kubernetes-remove.sh 
service "apache" deleted
service "catalog" deleted
service "customer" deleted
service "order" deleted
deployment "apache" deleted
deployment "catalog" deleted
deployment "customer" deleted
deployment "order" deleted
```
### Verify the app is deleted (only the generic kubernetes service should remain)
```
kubectl get all 
```
### Change the kubectl context back to Docker desktop

1. type `kubectl config use-context docker-desktop`

### Deleting the infrastructure from AWS

From the top-level of the repo

1. `terraform destroy -auto-approve`
2. Manually delete any load balancers associated with the cluster [in the web console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#LoadBalancers)
3. Manually delete the VPC associated with the cluster [in the web console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1)
4. `terraform destroy -auto-approve` again

### Clearing DNS cache

If needed...

```
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```
